## Wait, what?

Here it goes, my first post.
Why are you reading this? You've probably heard of my pretty ... down to earth opinions and decided to read my first post ever.
Or you feel obligated to read this because I just started and I might have forced you.

So, first of all, who is jNoxx?
Well, my name is Thijs Bastiaens, I'm (currently) 25 years old, live in this shite country called Belgium, I love my pets, girlfriend, but most of all (shhh)... my games. Which brings me to part 2.

Second of all, why am I writing this?
Well, I -LOVE- to rant about nearly anything, I'm a very opinionated person, and I sometimes don't know where to write it down, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, shouting my story at random people at the mall. Which is, apparently, not my best choice so far.
But with my affection towards gaming, games, publishers & gamers, I would love to bundle them here.

## What can you expect?

No freaking idea, I know a lot of people who like my opinions and takes on these particular topics. So I want to write down reviews, rants, opinions.
So I'd like to emphasize, this is a PERSONAL opinion.
I will use a lot of cuss words probably, or might come off a tad too strong, but that's how I express myself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Contact?

Just buzz me on Twitter (jNoxxx), Facebook (jNoxx), or basically any platform you can find me on.
Try to limit your communication to about 148 A4 pages, since I have quite the busy life.
